                        <p>My team and I had an incredible time at your retreat! It was relaxing, motvating, and just a fantastic time. The rooms were clean and modern and the food was amazing! I miss Chef John's pancakes so much! 
                            We were already the top sales team in our district but now we've surpassed our companies highest ever sales.
                            We work as a true team and I'm so proud of them everyday. We have also started helping teams in other districts with our
                            proven sales strategies...because we don't want to compete...we CREATE. Make this our companies best year ever!  </p>

                <p>This was our favourite picture from the retreat. We woke up early every morning to hike and watch the sunrise. 
                    It was such a calming and motivating experience. We became closer as a team and truly understand each other. This helped
                    our communication ten-fold. Not only have we tripled our production since we've been back but we doubled our
                    companies previous highest ever sales. Thank you Chef John for the amazing food! Thank you to our
                    facilitator, Tammy, for making the whole experience so easy. She took care of everything! </p>

                        <p> We all had such an amazing time on this retreat. We really got to understand what it
                                means to be a team and work together. We can only do so much on our own. It's the team that will
                                build our company. Since returning home our productivity has increased by 30%. We would all
